Also with Spotify being so large and active among\n            many people, it allows people to easily organise their own playlists.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Emotionify is not 100% accurate as emotion is highly opinion based and the values used\n            to sort songs are averages over the whole song. This tool however does give insight on\n            how well a computer can plot an emotional gradient with a list of songs.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            I made this project because I was curious if this data really did mean anything and if\n            my guess of the data being able to be used to sort playlists by emotion was correct. I\n            can leave that up to you to decide!\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            As you can see on the Sort page, I have also made the other audio features available for\n            you to play around with.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            You can find other projects and tutorials made by me on my site{\" \"}\n            <a href=\"https://nitratine.net/\">nitratine.net</a>.\n          </p>\n\n          <h2 className=\"text-center\">FAQ</h2>\n          <h5>Why is this called Emotionify?</h5>\n          <p>\n            By default, choosing a playlist on the Sort page will sort your music by{\" \"}\n            <code>Valence</code> and <code>Energy</code> which I had used in a previous project to\n            detect vague emotion of songs.\n          </p>\n          <h5>Will sorting a playlist remove duplicates?</h5>\n          <p>\n            Yes, if the sort functionality didn't remove duplicate songs they would be bunched up by\n            each other. Removing these allows for proper transitions into a different song.\n          </p>\n          <h5>Why do I have to log in so much?</h5>\n          <p>\n            When you log in, a token is stored on your machine that's used to ask Spotify for your\n            playlists (otherwise we couldn't see them). This token only lasts for an hour, meaning\n            if you use this site for more than an hour at a time, you will need to authorise the\n            application again.\n          </p>\n          <h5>What data do you store?</h5>\n          <p>\n            All data received from Spotify is stored locally on your machine; none of this is sent\n            off to some other server (apart from Spotify itself). You can view a summary of your\n            stored data by clicking on your name in the top right when logged in.\n          </p>\n          <h5>How do I clear all my data?</h5>\n          <p>\n            All data is stored in localStorage on your machine; simply logging out will clear all\n            this data.\n          </p>\n          <h5>I just added a playlist on Spotify but it isn't showing up here</h5>\n          <p>\n            We look for your playlists when you log in. If you want to use a playlist you\n            created/added after you logged into this site, log out and then log back in to get the\n            new playlist.\n          </p>\n          <h5>What are each of the audio features I select for the axis?</h5>\n          <p>\n            Here are some summaries from{\" \"}\n            <a href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/\">\n              Spotify\n            </a>\n            :\n          </p>\n          <ul>\n            <li>\n              <code>Acousticness</code>: A confidence measure from 0 to 1 of whether the track is\n              acoustic. 1 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <code>Danceability</code>: Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing\n              based on a combination of musical elements. A value of 0 is least danceable and 1 is\n              most danceable.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <code>Duration</code>: The duration of the track in milliseconds.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <code>Energy</code>: Energy is a measure from 0 to 1 and represents a perceptual\n              measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and\n              noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on\n              the scale.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <code>Instrumentalness</code>: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. The closer\n              the instrumentalness value is to 1, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal\n              content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but\n              confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <code>Key</code>: The estimated overall key of the track.

Higher\n              liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live.\n              A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <code>Loudness</code>: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness\n              values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative\n              loudness of tracks. Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <code>Mode</code>: Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type\n              of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and\n              minor is 0.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <code>Speechiness</code>: Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track.\n              Talk shows and audio books are closer to 1, songs made entirely of spoken words are\n              above 0.66, songs that contain both music and speech are typically around 0.33 - 0.66\n              and values below 0.33 represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <code>Tempo</code>: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM).\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <code>Time Signature</code>: An estimated overall time signature of a track. The time\n              signature (meter) is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar\n              (or measure).\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <code>Valence</code>: A measure from 0 to 1 describing the musical positiveness\n              conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive, while tracks with\n              low valence sound more negative.\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n        </Col>\n      </Row>\n    </Container>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default About;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
